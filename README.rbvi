This is the ChimeraX Toolshed.
We cloned the Cytoscape AppStore git repository
and created a "cxtoolshed" branch, which contains
all of our changes to the code.  To run the Toolshed,
we still have to supply some customization files
because we use the same code base for both the preview
and production Toolshed.

Customization files are in the "conf" directory and
are listed in .gitignore.
