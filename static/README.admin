There should either be (1) an admin symbolic link to

$PYTHON_ROOT/lib/python3.*/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/static/admin

or (2) that mapping should be handled by the web server's configuration file.

The latter is preferable so the admin link can be different for different
instances of the app store.
